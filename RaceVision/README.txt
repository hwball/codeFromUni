This is the first half a full year project completed in the third of univercity.

It focus on visualising the america's cup. The two jar make up the project with 
one creating a mock data stream by simulating a race and generating packets of 
data that follow the protocol set buy the 2017 america's cup and sending them 
out on port 4942. The second jar is the visualiser that receives these packets
and generates a representation of the race from them to be show to the user.
